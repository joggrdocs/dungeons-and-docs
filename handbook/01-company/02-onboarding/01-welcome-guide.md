# 🏰 Welcome to Spellforge Technologies!

Welcome brave adventurer to the Spellforge Technologies guild! This guide will help you navigate our realm and prepare you for the quests that lie ahead.

## 🧙 Engineering Culture

### How We Work
At Spellforge Technologies, we embrace an agile mindset with a focus on delivering value to our users. We work in two-week sprints, with regular planning, review, and retrospective rituals. We value autonomy and trust each team member to make decisions within their domain of expertise.

### Engineering Principles
1. Documentation is a first-class citizen, not an afterthought
2. Test-driven development leads to more maintainable codebases
3. Automate everything that can be automated
4. Code reviews are opportunities for learning, not gatekeeping
5. Technical debt should be managed, not ignored

## 🗺️ Your First Quest (Onboarding)

| Week | Focus | Activities |
|------|-------|------------|
| Week 1 | Onboarding & Setup | Set up development environment, meet the guild members, review documentation |
| Week 2 | Learning the Arcane Codex | Work on small tasks, pair program with experienced mages, attend sprint planning |
| Week 3 | Contributing | Take on your first feature, participate in code reviews, join team rituals |
| Week 4 | Growing | Receive feedback, set personal development goals, deepen your understanding |
