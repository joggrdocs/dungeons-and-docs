## üîÑ Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Description | Timeout | Failure Action |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Build | Compiles the application and creates artifacts | 10 minutes | Fail the pipeline and notify the team |
| Test | Runs unit and integration tests | 15 minutes | Fail the pipeline and notify the team |
| Lint | Checks code style and type errors | 5 minutes | Fail the pipeline and notify the team |
| Deploy to Staging | Deploys the application to the staging environment | 10 minutes | Retry once, then fail and notify the team |
| Integration Tests | Runs end-to-end tests against the staging environment | 20 minutes | Fail the pipeline and notify the team |
| Approval | Manual approval step for production deployments | 24 hours | Cancel the deployment if not approved |
| Deploy to Production | Deploys the application to the production environment | 15 minutes | Rollback to previous version and notify the team |

## üîê Environment Variables & Secrets

| Name | Description | Used In | Managed By |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| NODE_ENV | Environment name (development, staging, production) | All stages | CI/CD system |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | AWS access key for deployments | Deploy stages | Security team via GitHub Secrets |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS secret key for deployments | Deploy stages | Security team via GitHub Secrets |
| DATABASE_URL | Connection string for the database | Test and deploy stages | DevOps team via GitHub Secrets |

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Deployment Workflow

1. **Feature Branch**
   - Developer creates a feature branch from main
   - CI runs build, test, and lint on pull requests

2. **Merge to Main**
   - Pull request is reviewed and approved
   - Changes are merged to main
   - CI automatically deploys to staging

3. **Staging Verification**
   - Integration tests run against staging
   - QA team performs manual verification

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Engineering lead approves production deployment
   - CI deploys to production
   - Smoke tests verify deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution | Contact |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Build failures | Check for dependency issues or compilation errors | Frontend Guild |
| Test failures | Review test logs for specific failures | QA Guild |
| Deployment failures | Check AWS credentials and deployment logs | DevOps Guild |
