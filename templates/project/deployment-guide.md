# 🚀 Deployment Guide – [Project Name]

## 📦 Overview
Briefly describe what this project does and what deploying it accomplishes.  
> Example: "This service handles user authentication and authorization. Deployment pushes changes to the production environment via Vercel."


## 🧱 Prerequisites

- Access to [deployment platform] (e.g., Vercel, AWS, GCP)
- Necessary environment variables set (see `.env.example`)


## 🔁 Deployment Environments

| Environment | URL                        | Branch     | Notes                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Development | https://dev.example.com     | `main`     | Auto-deploys on push    |
| Staging     | https://staging.example.com | `staging`  | For pre-prod testing    |
| Production  | https://example.com         | `release`  | Manual approval required |


## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Option 1: Auto-deploy via CI/CD

> Triggered when changes are pushed to the corresponding branch.

1. Push your code to the correct branch (`main`, `staging`, or `release`)
2. CI pipeline builds and deploys automatically
3. Monitor deployment status in [CI/CD dashboard]

### Option 2: Manual Deployment (e.g., using Vercel CLI)

```bash
# Authenticate if needed
vercel login

# Deploy preview or production
vercel --prod
```

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file using `.env.example` as a reference. Below are the required variables:

| Variable Name     | Description                                      | Required In        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `DATABASE_URL`    | Postgres connection string                       | All environments   |
| `API_KEY`         | External API key (e.g., Stripe, SendGrid)        | Staging, Production |
| `JWT_SECRET`      | Secret key for token encryption                  | All environments   |
| `NODE_ENV`        | Application mode (`development`, `production`)   | All environments   |
| `LOG_LEVEL`       | Logging verbosity (`info`, `debug`, `error`)     | All environments   |
| `FRONTEND_URL`    | Public URL of the frontend (for CORS, redirects) | All environments   |

> 💡 Always keep secrets out of version control. Use a secure secrets manager or CI/CD environment settings when deploying.


## 🔍 Verifying a Deployment

- Visit the deployed URL and verify core functionality
- Check logs using [Sentry / Datadog / Cloud Logs]
- Run smoke tests (manual or automated)
- Confirm integration with dependent services (e.g., auth, database, APIs)


## 🧯 Rollback Instructions

1. Identify the previous successful deployment (via dashboard or Git SHA)
2. Revert the branch using Git:
   ```bash
   git revert <commit_sha>
   git push origin <branch>
   ```
3. Or re-deploy the last known good build via your CI/CD or platform dashboard
4. Verify the rollback and notify the team
