# 📜 Documentation Standards

1. **Anonymity** – Docs represent team knowledge, not individual authors.

2. **Clarity** – Names and summaries should make the purpose obvious.

3. **Discoverability** – Docs should be easy to find in logical locations.

Following these rules ensures:

* 🚀 **Faster development** – No getting stuck in question loops.

* 🛹 **Easier onboarding** – New devs ramp up quickly.

* 🔮 **Future-proofing** – Docs help when revisiting complex code.

## **Creating Documentation**

| Documentation         | When to Create                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **RFCs**             | Before development starts               |
| **Architecture Docs**| For new major features                  |
| **Guides**           | When standard processes change          |
| **Walkthroughs**     | When frequently asked questions arise   |

> \[!TIP]
>
> Repo-specific docs should live close to the code. This includes implementation details, API specs, and setup instructions. Higher-level docs—like **RFCs, system diagrams, and architecture overviews**—belong in a centralized knowledge base (e.g., Confluence, Notion, Joggr, or a dedicated GitHub repo).
