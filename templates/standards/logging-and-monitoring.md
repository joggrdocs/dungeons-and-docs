# 📡 Logging & Monitoring – Quick Guide for New Devs

Welcome! Here’s how our team handles logging and monitoring, and what’s expected of you as a developer.

## 🧠 Why We Log & Monitor

We use logging and monitoring to:

- Understand how the system behaves in production  
- Catch and fix issues quickly  
- Improve reliability and performance over time  

Good observability is part of how we write and ship quality software.

## 🛠 Logging – What You Should Know

- We use **structured logs** (JSON or key-value)  
- Logs are centralized in **[e.g., Datadog / Logtail / CloudWatch]**  
- Don’t log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)

**What to include in logs:**
- Clear messages about system or business events  
- Useful context like `user_id`, `request_id`, or `operation`  
- Appropriate log levels:  
  - `INFO` for normal ops  
  - `WARN` for unexpected behavior  
  - `ERROR` for failures  

When writing or updating features, include logs that help future debugging. If something goes wrong, your logs should explain what happened.

## 📈 Monitoring – What You Should Know

- We monitor app health, performance, and key workflows  
- Dashboards show metrics like error rate, latency, and resource usage  
- Alerts are triggered on critical issues and sent to Slack or PagerDuty  

After a deploy, check dashboards and logs to make sure everything looks healthy. If something breaks, your logs and metrics should help explain why.

## 🧑‍💻 Your Responsibilities

- Write useful, structured logs for your code  
- Don’t log secrets or sensitive info  
- Add metrics or alerting if the feature needs it  
- Check observability tools after shipping changes  
- Ask questions if you're unsure — we help each other learn

_Observability is part of building things that work well — not just when we ship, but when it matters most: in production._
